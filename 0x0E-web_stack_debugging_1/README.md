0x0E Web stack debugging
Finding and correcting flaws in software that prevent it from functioning properly is a process known as debugging. You will learn how to use debugging tools like gdb or built-in tools that come with IDEs as you develop as an advanced programmer and an industry engineer. But it's crucial to comprehend the ideas and procedures involved in manual debugging. The second section of the ideal framework and blueprint for identifying flaws in the web stack (in this case, remote containers) is covered in this project.

Challenge:

Using your debugging skills, find out what‚Äôs keeping your Ubuntu container‚Äôs Nginx installation from listening on port 80. Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy as many containers as you need to debug the issue.
